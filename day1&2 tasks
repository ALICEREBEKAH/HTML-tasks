        <u>HTML</u>(HyperText Markup Language) is essential because it forms the foundation of web development.<br>
         It provides the basic structure for web pages, allowing content such as text, images,<br>
        videos, and links to be organized and displayed in a browser. HTML uses a system of elements<br>
        (tags) to define different parts of a webpage, such as headings (h1), paragraphs (p),<br>
        links (a), and images (img>).HTML ensures that web pages are properly formatted, making <br>
        them accessible and readable across different devices and browsers. It also supports the <br>
        integration of CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity), enhancing user experience <br>
        and functionality. HTML5, the latest version, introduced new elements like header, footer,<br>
        and article, improving the semantic structure of web.<br>
